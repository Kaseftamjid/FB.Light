# FB.Light Responsive LED Control

Using this while playing around with WS2812-LEDs. Build a nice RGB-LED-Lamp (milk glass / 11x8 LEDs) with it:

## Used libraries / software

Fork of FastLED 3.1.3 library (included in this repo: see libraries-folder!):
https://github.com/coryking/FastLED

We are using this fork because it supports DMA which removes flicker issues. Enabled via `#define FASTLED_ESP8266_DMA`. You must use pin 3 for your LED stripe!

## How to start

If you aren't familiar with how to setup your ESP8266, see the readme on McLighting's git.  It's well written and should get you up and running.

In short you will:

1.  Configure the Arduino IDE to communicate with the ESP8266.
2.  Upload the sketch (from this repo). The sketch is setup for a 88 pixel WS2812B GRB LED Strip on pin 3 with DMA enabled.   
    (change the applicable options in "definitions.h" to your desire).
3.  Patch FastLED Library (not neccessary when using the library included in this repo!):

```arduino
// Note, you need to patch FastLEDs in order to use this.  You'll get an
// error related to <avr\pgmspace.h>. Saves more than 3k given the palettes
//
// Simply edit <fastled_progmem.h> and update the include (Line ~29):

#if FASTLED_INCLUDE_PGMSPACE == 1
#if (defined(__AVR__))
#include <avr\pgmspace.h>
#else
#include <pgmspace.h>
#endif
#endif
```

4.  On first launch, the ESP8266 will advertise it's own WiFi network for you to connect to. Once you connect to it, launch your browser
    and the web interface is self explanatory. (If the interface doesn't load, type in "192.168.4.1" into your browser and hit go).
5.  Once the ESP is on your wifi network, you can then upload the required files for the web interface by typing the IP address
    of the ESP followed by "/upload" (i.e. 192.168.1.20/upload).  Then upload the files from the folder labeled "upload these" from this         repo.
6.  Once you have finished uploading, type in the IP of the ESP into your browser and you should be up and running!

## Updating the firmware

After the first flash, you can update the firmware via OTA by typing the IP address of the ESP followed by "/update" (i.e. 192.168.1.20/update). WIFI config and uploaded files will stay untouched.

## Palettes on SPIFFS

Normally, you use [PaletteKnife](http://fastled.io/tools/paletteknife/) to generate arrays with the palette info.  You then compile this data into your project.  I wanted to be able to update the palettes without recompiling, so I moved them to files in SPIFFS (/palettes directory).  There is a little python program that basically takes the logic from PaletteKnife and outputs a binary file with the palette data instead.  Load these binary files to SPIFFS using the [Arduino ESP8266 filesystem uploader](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin) or manually.
